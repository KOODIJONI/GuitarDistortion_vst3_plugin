# Features‚≠ê
__On/Off Button:__ Toggles the guitar effect on or off.

__Gain:__ Adjusts the input gain to control the level of distortion.

__Treble:__ Controls the frequency of the high-pass filter to shape the high-end response.

__Bass:__ Controls the frequency of the low-pass filter to shape the low-end response.

__Dry/Wet:__ Mixes the distorted and original signals for a more subtle or aggressive effect.

__Volume:__ Adjusts the output gain to control the final volume of the effect.


# How it works
This plugin works by using a soft-clip function on the user‚Äôs audio signal. Soft-clipping changes the sound by gently cutting the highest peaks of the signal, which creates a type of distortion.

Unlike hard-clipping, which cuts the sound sharply, soft-clipping makes the peaks rounder and smoother. This gives the sound a warmer and more natural feel, instead of making it harsh.

You can control how strong the effect is using gain knob ‚Äî from a light, warm touch to a heavier, more distorted sound.

__Visualization__

Lets imagine this sine wave is our sound signal.

This curve shows how input values are transformed when soft clipping is applied.
It compresses the peaks while keeping the waveform smooth.

Here‚Äôs what the sine wave looks like after passing through the soft-clip function.

When we increase the input gain, the effect of the soft-clip becomes more pronounced.
The waveform is more compressed at the peaks, resulting in more harmonic content and a warmer, saturated sound.
